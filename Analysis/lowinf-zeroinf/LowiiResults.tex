\section{Results for Low Incidence Infection}

The effects of a small, low density infection within a nematode population were evaluated. Unique combinations of virus characteristics including infection rates, virulences, and viral loads were tested \ref{tbl:lowiiprops}.  The simulation was performed over 5 iterations per treatments over 5 years with data recorded at 4 day intervals.  Additionally, the simulation was repeated 20 times for a total of 100 replicates per unique combination.  The environment agent was set to temperature data from Champaign County, IL.    (Nematode settings and crops planting every year)

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine how the low incidence infections affect the Nematode populations over time
\item Determine how similar/ different varying levels of infection rates affect the various life stages of the SCN
\item Determine which parameters are responsible for resulting changes in nematode populations
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results and Discussion}


\subsection{Distribution analysis--Kolmogrov Smirnov}

To visually discern whether or not the virus infection had an impact on SCN populations over time, the nematode population data were compared between the low incidence infection treatments and the zero infection treatments using the Kolmogrov-Smirnov (KS) test.

All boxplots have a width of 0.1 years.  Baselines are drawn in each plot, which were derived from Kolmogrov-Smirnov statistics calculated between randomized subsamples of SCN populations within the low incidence infection treatment, to compare the results with natural variation of the D statistic.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Virus Parameters over Time}
	Viral virulences decreased over time with respect to initial infection rates in all cases. These decreases were each significantly different from the control treatment ($p < 0.0001$, Kruskal-Wallis Test). Furthermore, it appeared the infection rates that were tested significantly affected the distributions of virulence values over time. (maybe we should do nested hypothesis testing?  test the virulences at certain years against other years and then across infection rates?)
